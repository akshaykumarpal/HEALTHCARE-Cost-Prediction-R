# HEALTHCARE Cost Prediction using R

Environment: R (3.3.1), R Studio (1.0.136) and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2016

On given data we formed a table structure and relations in SQL and made an ODBC connection between SQL and R studio. For variable selection and regularization, we used LASSO in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. We aimed on studying different approaches for healthcare cost prediction and compared different algorithms like Naive Bayes Classifier, LASSO Logistic Regression and Decision Tree based on confusion matrix as performance metrics.
